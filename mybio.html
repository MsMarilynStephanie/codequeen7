    <h5> WHY DID I PICK INTEREST IN COHORT 7 </h5>
    <p5> I picked interest into the code queen program because i wanna add the skills attained onto my proffesion and grow my career. Secondly i have recently developed interest into a stem career and i was looking for a way to break into tech without a science, math or engineering background and oooppps Twitter was my life saver i landed on the Code Queens hash tag and immediately checked out the Educating the girl child program and this was the right opportunity for me to learn programming skills. Thank you so much for the opportunity </p5>
